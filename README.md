# Car-Number-Plate-Detection-with-OpenCV
In this project we are detecting car number plates by using harcasdaes. A video is also added with it. You can change video in line number 7 and test it for your video as well. Also keep in mind that OpenCV is not a SOTA (State of the art) model so it it is not that accurate. Once you will run the program you have to press 'q' to quit that video.
